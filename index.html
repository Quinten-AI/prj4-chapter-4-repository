				<p class="text-fixed-cost">Fixed costs are defined as “Costs that remain the same despite the volume of goods or services produced. (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010, p.41).” Looking at the IMAX Income statement there are multiple fixed costs mentioned: Leases (facility rent), Administration costs, General expenses (office equipment, etc) and Salaries. These specific costs can be defined as fixed due to their solidarity from sales numbers, they need to be payed whether a company sells millions or nothing at all.</p>
				<p class="guy">Variable costs are defined as “Costs that vary proportionally with the volume of goods or services produced. (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010, p.41).” IMAX variable costs fluctuate heavily, since it depends on the amount of leased equipment, the number of film productions the company is involved in, and the type of equipment necessary for the productions. <span id="extra"> Extra text. </span>
				Direct costs are defined as “a price that can be directly tied to the production of specific goods or services. (Investopedia)” For IMAX there are multiple products which have their own direct costs this includes: Theater system components, Camera equipment, post-production services and film production.
